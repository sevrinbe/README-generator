  ## Description
  
  ${projectDesc}
  
  ## Table of Contents (Optional)
  
  If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
  
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [Credits](#credits)
  - [License](#license)
  
  ## Installation
  
  ${installInstruct}

  ## Usage
  
  ${usageInput}
  
  To add a screenshot, create an  folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

  ## Starting the Program

  ${howToStart}

  ## Authors
  
  ${typedAuthors}
  
  ## License
  
  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

  üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
  
  ## Badges

  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
  
  ## Features
  
  If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
  
  ## How to Contribute
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
